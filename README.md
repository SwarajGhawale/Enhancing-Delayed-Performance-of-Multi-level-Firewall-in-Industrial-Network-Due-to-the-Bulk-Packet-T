# Enhancing-Delayed-Performance-of-Multi-level-Firewall-in-Industrial-Network-Due-to-the-Bulk-Packet-Transfer
We researched on various packet filtering techniques and analyzed performance achievable by  Firewall Rule Migration technique which was used to quantify the delay of bulk packet transfer.  Research Authors obtained an average workload reduction equal to 60% for the considered configurations by using Rule Migration  Techniques
